# Understanding-Quantum-Many-Body-Systems-using-Tensor-Networks-and-Matrix-Product-States.

Using Julia and ITensor I explore how Tensor networks and Matrix product states can be used to analyse and simulate quantum many body systems such as spin chains and the transverse Ising model. Exploring how these techniques can provide significant speedup and capacity for simulating such systems.
